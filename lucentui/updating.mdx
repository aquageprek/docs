# üîÑ Updating LucentUI

LucentUI receives updates regularly to bring new UI improvements, fixes, and compatibility with the latest Paymenter versions.

You can update the theme using **manual update** or using the recommended **PTB (.paytheme)** method.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Manual Update

This is the standard method if you installed LucentUI from a ZIP file.

<Steps>
<Step title="Download the latest ZIP">
Get the latest version of `lucentui.zip` from your purchase source.
</Step>

<Step title="Upload and overwrite">
Replace the existing theme directory:
```bash
mv lucentui.zip /var/www/paymenter/themes
cd /var/www/paymenter/themes
unzip -o lucentui.zip
```
The `-o` flag will **overwrite** the previous files with the new ones. 
</Step>

<Step title="Rebuild the theme">
After replacing the files, navigate to your Paymenter root and rebuild assets:
```bash
cd /var/www/paymenter
npm run build lucentui
```
</Step>
</Steps>

## üì¶ Update via PTB (.paytheme)

If you used PTB, updating is much simpler.

<Steps>

<Step title="Place the new .paytheme file">
Replace the old `.paytheme` file with the new one (you can rename if needed).
</Step>

<Step title="Run update command">
Execute the update command using PTB:

```bash
ptb update -t lucentui lucentui.paytheme
```

If you renamed the file or theme, match the names accordingly. 
</Step>

</Steps>

## üß™ Checking Version

```bash
ptb info -t lucentui
```
