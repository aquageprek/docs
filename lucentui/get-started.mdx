Run this script to install PTB globally:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QKing-Official/PTB/refs/heads/main/installer | bash
```
</Step>

<Step title="Move the .paytheme file">
Upload the `lucentui.paytheme` file to your hosted Paymenter server (any location is fine).
</Step>

<Step title="Import using PTB">
Import the theme with this command:
```bash
ptb import -t lucentui.paytheme
```
</Step>

<Step title="Activate LucentUI">
Go to your **Admin → Settings → Theme**, and select `lucentui`.
</Step>
</Steps>

## 💡 Tips

* PTB also supports `update`, `rename`, and `validate` features.
* Want to change theme name or preview before installing? Use:
```bash
ptb rename -t lucentui.paytheme -n my-custom-theme
ptb list -t lucentui.paytheme
```
