# 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

If you're running into issues with the LucentUI theme, don’t worry! Here’s a list of common problems and how to resolve them.

---

## 🚫 Theme Not Rendering / Blank Page

**Symptoms:**
- Page is blank or not styled
- Header/footer is missing

**Possible Causes:**
- Theme not properly installed or not selected
- Missing required assets or build step not completed
- Base URL not set correctly
- `Theme.php` is malformed (e.g. missing comma, invalid array)

**Fixes:**
- Make sure LucentUI is selected as the active theme in Paymenter settings
- Run `php artisan app:settings:change app_url` to set the Base URL
- Build the theme again using `npm run build lucentui`
- Check the theme folder path: should be `/themes/lucentui`
- Validate your `theme.php` using an online PHP linter

## ⚠️ Error 500 - Internal Server Error

**Symptoms:**
- Page displays error 500 or “SERVER ERROR”

**Possible Causes:**
- Syntax error in theme files
- PHP version incompatibility
- Laravel cache issues

**Fixes:**
- Run `php artisan config:clear`, `php artisan view:clear`, and `php artisan cache:clear`
- Check `storage/logs/laravel.log` for exact error trace
- Ensure you’re using PHP 8.3 or higher (as required by Paymenter)

---

## 🧩 Theme Settings Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Custom theme settings are missing in the admin panel

**Possible Causes:**
- `Theme.php` file not loaded properly
- Syntax error in one of the setting definitions

**Fixes:**
- Double check `Theme.php` syntax (especially commas, quotes, brackets)
- Refresh the admin dashboard or relogin
- Re-import the theme using `ptb import -t lucentui`

---

## 🖼️ Background Image Not Showing

**Symptoms:**
- Background image set in settings does not appear

**Possible Causes:**
- Invalid URL format
- Image is blocked due to CORS

**Fixes:**
- Make sure the image URL is direct and ends with `.jpg`, `.png`, etc.
- Try uploading the image to a CDN or your own server
- Ensure browser isn’t blocking external content

---

## 🎨 Color Settings Not Applying

**Symptoms:**
- Primary or secondary colors are not updating

**Possible Causes:**
- Cache not cleared
- Incorrect `hsl()` or `hex` format

**Fixes:**
- Check that all colors are valid (e.g. `hsl(240, 100%, 50%)`)
- Clear browser cache or use hard reload (Ctrl + F5)
- Try clearing views: `php artisan view:clear`

---

## 🔧 Custom JS/CSS Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- Custom scripts or styles have no effect

**Possible Causes:**
- Syntax errors in your custom code
- Content-Security-Policy (CSP) blocking inline scripts

**Fixes:**
- Wrap CSS in `<style>` and JS in `<script>` (automatically done if using theme settings)
- Avoid using `document.write` in JS
- Check browser console for errors (F12 > Console)

---

## 🧼 Markdown Not Rendering in Footer / CTA

**Symptoms:**
- Footer text or other markdown content displays as raw text

**Fixes:**
- Ensure you're not escaping special characters (like `*`, `_`)
- Wrap content correctly — avoid unclosed tags

---

## ❌ “ptb import” Not Updating Theme

**Symptoms:**
- You updated theme files but nothing changes

**Fixes:**
- Run `ptb import -t lucentui` again
- Ensure the import target folder is correct
- Restart server if needed

---

## 🧪 Still Broken?

**Checklist:**
- ✅ Is the theme installed in the right folder?
- ✅ Is your Paymenter version up to date?
- ✅ Are you using supported PHP version?
- ✅ Did you clear Laravel & browser cache?
- ✅ Did you check the logs?

> 🧠 **Pro Tip:** Always test new settings on a staging environment before applying them live!
